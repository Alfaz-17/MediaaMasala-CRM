1. DESIGN PRINCIPLES
The CRM system is built on five core design principles that guide every UI/UX decision:
1.1 Clarity Over Cleverness
•	Every action should be obvious to users
•	Use familiar UI patterns
•	Clear visual hierarchy with consistent spacing
•	Meaningful labels and helpful tooltips

1.2 Efficiency for Daily Use
•	Minimize clicks to complete common tasks
•	Smart defaults based on user context
•	Keyboard shortcuts for power users
•	Quick actions always visible and accessible

1.3 Role-Aware Interface
•	UI adapts to user permissions automatically
•	Hide unavailable actions (don&#x2019;t just disable)
•	Role-specific dashboards and views
•	Contextual help based on user role

1.4 Data Integrity
•	Required fields clearly marked with asterisks
•	Inline validation with helpful error messages
•	Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
•	Auto-save functionality for long forms

1.5 Professional Polish
•	Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
•	Subtle animations for user feedback
•	Loading states for all asynchronous actions
•	Empty states that guide users to next steps
